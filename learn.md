# Things to learn

1. Naive Bayes Classifier
2. SVM
3. Nb -SVM algo : This is actually an SVM (Support Vector Machine) with Naive Bayes’ features. It creates a simple model variant where an SVM is built over NB log-count ratio “r” as feature values. 
The log form is an attempt to linearise the NB. Thus, in NB-SVM , the original features in the SVM, which are in vector form, are converted into a scalar by a scalar/dot product multiplication of each element with the log-count ratio ‘r’.
4. Autograd based differentiation -- PyTorch and TensorFlow
5. Decision Tree
6. Random Forest
