# Machine Learning

Given inputs $x_1, . . . , x_N$ which are considered as constants, or fixed, and not as random variables. This is called a discriminative framework.
When inputs are considered as random variables its called a generative framework.
In the generative framework, we calculate the probability of an input given an observed output, which is especially important for classification.
The generative framework however requires us to make the strong assumption that there is a true probability distribution for the inputs x.
